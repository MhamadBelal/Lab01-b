# Lab01-b

The purpose of the program is to create a math game that takes user input, performs various calculations, and utilizes error handling to provide a result based on the input.

To run the program, you would need to compile and execute the C# code. Here are the steps to run the program:

Set up a .NET Core environment on your machine if it's not already installed.
Create a new console application project in your preferred integrated development environment (IDE), such as Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code.
Replace the default code in the Program.cs file with the code provided earlier.
Build the project to ensure there are no compilation errors.
Run the program by executing the compiled executable file or using the run/debug functionality provided by your IDE.
Once the program is running, it will prompt you to enter numbers, perform calculations, and display the results in the console window.

The program interface is a console application, so it doesn't have a graphical user interface (GUI). It interacts with the user through text-based prompts and outputs the results and messages in the console window where you execute the program.
